# F´ LED Blinker Tutorial for Arduinos

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the F Prime Arduino LED Blinker tutorial.

This project is an implementation of the [F´ LED Blinker ARM Linux Tutorial](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/tutorials-led-blinker/docs/led-blinker/) which will allow you to test on Arduino-based microcontrollers using the [`fprime-arduino` toolchain](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino.git) instead of `fprime-arm-linux`. 

This version uses a scaled down deployment of F´ to account for the limited resources available on baremetal hardware.

To run through the tutorial, please visit the F´ website and look for the tutorial section: https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov
